    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights.

    _ CHAP. I. That the Doctrine of the Millennium was never generally received in the Church of Chriſt, is proved, 1. From the Teſtimony of Juſtin Martyr and Irenaeus, § I. Of Euſebius, Origen and Stephanus Gobarus, and the Diſtinction which then obtained betwixt the Allegoriſts and the Diſciples of the Letter, § II. An Anſwer to the Pretended Tradition of Papias, mentioned by Irenaeus, § III. The Millennium of the Ancients differed from that which is now aſſerted by the moſt judicious of the modern Millennaries in Five Particulars: (1ſt,) The Ancients generally held, That the Temple, or City of Jeruſalem ſhould be new built. (2dly,) That all the Juſt were then to riſe, and not Martyrs only. (3dly,) That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould then Reign on Earth. (4thly,) That they ſhould fare Deliciouſly, and enjoy Corporal Delights. (5thly,) That they ſhould get Children; all which Things are denied by the Modern Millennaries, § IV. The Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines according to the Literal Scriptures cited for the Millennium, by thoſe Ancients who eſpouſed that Doctrine, § V. This Error of ſome of the Fathers, as to the Millennium, w ll not invalidate their Authority as to any thing delivered by them as Eye-Witneſſes, or which they deliver as the Practice of the Church of Chriſt in their Days, § VI.

    _ CHAP. II. How far I differ from the Ancient and Modern Millennaries, and in what I agree with them, §. I. The Propoſition that the true Millennium is only a Reign of the Converted Jews, and of the Gentiles flowing in to them, Ibid. Where it is noted, 1. That all ſpiritual Bleſſings have been ſtill conveyed from the Jews to other Nations. 2. That there will be a glorious Converſion of the Jews to the Chriſtian Faith, §. II. That the Deſcription of this Converſion of the Jews made by their own Prophets and Writers, anſwers fully to the Millennium of St. John, which he ſpeaks of in the very words of the ſaid Prophets, §. III. The Characters which the Patrons of the Millennium give of thoſe times accord exactly with the Characters given by the Prophets of the Converſion of the Jews, §. IV. The Prophets ſeem to intimate that this Converſion ſhall be effected by a full influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, §. V. All the Paſſages cited to this Effect from the Jewiſh Writers ſpeak only of the Millennium, the Reſurrection, the New Heavens and Earth belonging to the Jewiſh Nation, §. VI.
